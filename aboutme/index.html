    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>
        I'm from Venezuela, I was born in a small town where I also grew up. I finished high school and I got graduated as a chef likewise 
        got several certificates in different areas. I got baptized in The Chruch of Jesus Christ of The Latter Day Saints approximately twenty 
        months ago, and since then my life has changed drastically for good. It was weird being that I was a person that always 
        consider myself skeptical about all related to God and religions, but when I met the gospel it was different, my perspective
        changed. I got here on the gospel path because of a beautiful person that I met also I'm really thankful 
        for the missionaries that taught me, they have shown me the truth, 
        my eyes were opened and I know I'm moving forward in this path of light, I'm trying my best to be the best 
        version of myself, there are many things to do and change but with the guidance of Christ, 
        I'll be able to achieve it. I'm not yet married but I'm engaged to the girl of my dreams (the one 
        that I mentioned before) I'm going to marry her very soon.

        I love computers, this passion started when I was a kid. Currently, I work teaching English to kids and teenagers
        however I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Applied Technology to work as a full-stack developer, I love teaching
        but I want to follow my dream of creating awesome things through computers, after I get my degree I would like
        to continue studying something else relate to this field, some of the things that I like to do are: play video games, read books and 
        watch movies.
