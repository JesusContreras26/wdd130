      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My webpage will be designed about nature, it's a very important topic that has been discussed for years because it's what Heavenly Father has brought to us to live on, it's what we depend on to survive, in the last decades, nature has been treating as a secondary topic and we haven't focused in the damage that we are causing to it, because what is destroying nature is ourselves, these are some of the main causes that are destroying our environment: Pollution, burning fossil fuels and deforestation. I took this topic though to try to create awareness and also show the importance of nature, I wanted to focus on kids because as I've observed it's been pretty rough to make this impact on adults, they're centered more on material things and richness that in their future and the future of the next generations, kids are more susceptible to changes and if you show to them things in a creative and impactful way it'll be something that they'll remember for the rest of their lives.<br><br>
	      Kids will see on my webpage how fascinating nature could be, and all the magnificent things that our Heavenly Father created for us. The home page will be centered on the remarkable first look I want kids to focus their attention on and continue navigating through it. This page will have a menu to navigate through and the footer will be the same for all the pages, I'll have a hero image that will consist of three images, each of them connected to the other three pages, over that hero image I'm going to, behind it would be other small image related to the topic and to a side of the image there will be a message, a small text introducing kids to the purpose of the webpage, then next to that part, there will be three images, each of that images will be a hyperlink that will take you to the other three pages, those images will have a heading of the names of those pages likewise I'll add a small box of text with some information about those pages.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        My first page will be about flora. Flora refers to all types of plant life that exist they are classified in diverse forms, depending on different factors although the main one is the geographical location. The most beautiful thing about this essential part of our natural environment is that they can thrive in any part of our different earth's climate giving us a large variety of flora, unique and special. Some of those environments that we have with exclusive flora are the following:
        <br><br>Dragon's Blood Forest: This remote archipelago is located in Socotra, Yemen, and is considered the “Jewel of Arabia”, which is the home of the non-common dragon blood tree, growing atop granite massifs. This forest has been thriving for millions of years therefore there you can find unique species of flora that are in not any other place on the earth, it's considered a space that has frozen at the time.
        <br><br>Amazon Rainforest: It's considered the world's richest and most-varied biological reservoir, located in Brazil, this means that there is a very large diversity of ecosystems living together creating this magnificent forest, Amazon Rainforest is considered the lung of the earth, it has so many florae on it that it can almost immediately clear the air that pass by that forest, Amazon Rainforest is essential for us and also to all the millions of living beings which inhabit it. 
        <br><br>Redwood National Park: Located in the United States in northern California with an area of 200 miles, its vast space was considered by the UNESCO World Heritage Site and International Biosphere Reserve. This forest has half of the total of the world's oldest redwoods. It's an amazing place to go to and do different activities like camping, bike rides, or long walks. Imagine being surrounded by giant trees and breathing pure air meanwhile you have fun.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        My second page will be centered on the fauna. Fauna means all types of species of animals that inhabit the world. When discussing fauna, includes birds (Avifauna), fish (Piscifauna), microbes (Micro fauna), bigger animals that we see in the wild (Megafauna), etc. Fauna likewise flora is classified in the zone, taking into count climate, environmental conditions, and even the time period. These are some of the more fascinating species found over our wide world:
        <br><br>Immortal jellyfish: Sounds breathtaking right?  An immortal being. Well, Turritopsis dohrnii also known as Immortal jellyfish, is a rare jellyfish that could revert from its adult form to its juvenile polyp state, they go down to the ocean floor and became a baby again retracting its tentacles, shrinking its body starting the whole cycle again and what is more astonishing of this is that they can do it over and over again.
        <br><br>Polar bear: The great white northern can be found in the Artic region, polar bears are stocky, with long necks, relatively small heads, and short tails; they're the most powerful carnivores although one interesting fact is less than 2% of polar bears hunts are successful, they live most of their lives around water and ice, they hunt alone but are socials though, adult polar bears are great swimmers, they can swim for hours to go from one piece of ice to another, they are top predators in their food web this means that there are no other species who hunt them, they play a vital role balancing their ecosystem.
        <br><br>Atlantic puffins: These beautiful birds have similar colors to penguins with a beautiful colorful beak. During winter it fades to a gray tone and blooms with color during spring, they use it to look attractive to potential mates, like polar bears they spent most of their lives on the sea, resting on the water meanwhile waves move them back on forth when not swimming, most of the puffins' diet consists of small fish like herrings. Surprisingly they are quick flyers by flapping their wings up to 400 times per minute they can reach speeds of 55 miles an hour; Iceland is the site where most of them reproduce 60% of their inhabit can be found there.

      <h3>[Page 4]</h3>
      <p>
        My last page will be for sharing a message about the importance of nature, how we need it, and what we have to do to preserve it, likewise, I'll tell them if they would like that all those wonderful things that they saw in my previous pages continue to exist they have to investigate and learn more about how to take care of nature, my message will be something like this:<br><br>
	      Nature is essential for us and for all the living things that subsist on the earth, our planet is formed of a variety of ecosystems each of them connect to the others, with food webs, and hierarchies, one depends upon the other, earth works perfectly, therefore, altering one of them could cause an irreversible change of what we will regret the consequence, we have to start making a difference and act, we have to protect our environment and all that depend on it, earth has been a gift that has been conceived to us, we have to take care of what we have, as you can see it's magnificent, search and learn more about our mother nature and being different.
